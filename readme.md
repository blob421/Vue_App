Introduction :
-------------
This is the front-end of my web app. Currently deployed on Azure as a static web app, it uses flask as back-end for server side operations and a Postgres SQL database for storage on the cloud. Data is fetched using a containerized version of my Fetch script running on Azure. It features two plotly graphs updated in real time, a personnalized dashboard, login/register pages as well as a way to change passwords.

 - An integration of this model to the current plotly graph 
 - A way to leave comments as users
