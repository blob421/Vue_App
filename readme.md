Introduction :
-------------
This repository contains the front-end of my web app. It is currently deployed on Azure and interacts with my backend and a Postgres SQL 
database on the cloud. Data is fetched using a containerized version of my Fetch script running on Azure. It features a plotly graph updated in real time. 

Features :
------------------
Hashed passwords :heavy_check_mark:
Real time updates :heavy_check_mark:
Personnalized dashboard :heavy_check_mark:
Fully compatible with mobiles :heavy_check_mark:
Cool UI :heavy_check_mark: 

What's next to come :
---------------------
1. An LSTM prediction model for Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum 
2. An integration of this model to the current plotly graph 
3. A way to leave comments as users
