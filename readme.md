Introduction :
-------------
This repository contains the front-end of my web app. It is currently deployed on Azure and interacts with my backend and an AZURE SQL 
database on the cloud. Data is fetched using a containerized version of my Fetch script running on Azure. It updates a plotly graph in real
time. Currently, there is only this graph, sign-up and sign-in functions and a dashboard . The app is fully compatible with mobile devices and 
tablets.

What's next to come :
---------------------
1. An LSTM prediction model for Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum 
2. An integration of this model to the current plotly graph 
3. A way to leave comments as users
